# Test Project

Thank you for taking the time to review my test project. I appreciate the opportunity to showcase my abilities and demonstrate my understanding of the given requirements.

## About the Project

This project was completed within a day, and I want to acknowledge that with more time, I could have implemented additional features and made further improvements to enhance the overall quality of the project.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that represents the shopping cart page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling the HTML elements.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that integrates with the PayPal API and handles user interactions.
- `thankyou.html`: The thank you page that users are redirected to after a successful payment.
- `water.jp`: The picture of the water bottle.

## Project Description

The web page simulates a basic shopping cart page on a web store. It displays a product with its details and provides an area for the buyer's information, which is pre-filled in editable HTML fields. The PayPal payment process is initiated by clicking the provided button, which is rendered by the PayPal client-side script.

## Note

I want to express my gratitude once again for considering me for this test. I enjoyed working on the project and found it to be a valuable learning experience. I hope you find the project to be a fair representation of my skills and potential. I appreciate your understanding of the limitations imposed by the time constraints.

Thank you once again for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Leonardo Franco Dziekanski
